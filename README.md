Configuring a new project without user ownership
================================================

```
rails new my_exercise -m https://raw.github.com/caelum/gnarus-exercise/master/template.rb
```

You will be prompted about add <code>devise</code> into your application, then is up
to you accept or not. The template will handle all the configurations for you.


TODO
====

- update method UPDATE from exercise to be safe
- exercisecontroller entire code should work with/without devise
- no need to override gnarusexercises:exercise would be lovely
- eval solution?
